#! What is Open Source ?
# Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and
# enhance."Source code" is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; 
# it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a "program" or 
# "application"—works. Programmers who have access to a computer program's source code can improve that 
# program by adding features to it or fixing parts that don't always work correctly.
#! Emerging application of FOSS in various sectors.
# Open source philosophy is changing the way people think about technology and society. A couple of years
# ago you had to fork out a lot of money to get a good graphics editing computer program (such as Adobe 
# Photoshop). Now you can just download a free version of GIMP. You can even modify its source code to 
# make it better, or simply different, if you feel so inclined. Collaborative open source software 
# projects such as Linux and Apache (a web server package) have demonstrated that a large and complex 
# system of code can be built, maintained, developed and extended in a non-proprietary environment 
# (Source: Weber 2004, p. 2). Outside of the computer world, people have created open source beer and 
# cola. Vast amounts of informative content are being release as open source on sites such as Wikipedia.
# Blogging is becoming a household term, with people globally sharing their views and thoughts for free
# to anyone who wants to listen, watch or read. Even open source pharmaceutical development is on the 
# horizon.Despite the fact that most people would have never predicted that a system based around people
# working for free would work, open source philosophy is making a big impact. The thing to understand is
# that open source embraces the philosophy of sharing, and because of this, concepts such as piracy are 
# no longer a problem. You are encouraged to share and spread open source products as much as you like.
# You can copy and redistribute, even after modification. This provides users with a freedom that is not
# obtainable from proprietary products (as illustrated right throughout this document), and creates 
# remarkable opportunities for businesses and entrepreneurs around the world, especially in developing 
# countries.

#! Types of licenses
#What are the different types of software licenses?
#Here are five types of common software license models you should know about. Four are examples of open 
# source licenses (which allow you to reuse code to some extent), and one disallows any reuse whatsoever.
#Public domain. This is the most permissive type of software license. When software is in the public 
# domain, anyone can modify and use the software without any restrictions. But you should always make 
# sure it’s secure before adding it to your own codebase. Warning: Code that doesn’t have an explicit 
# license is NOT automatically in the public domain. This includes code snippets you find on the internet.

#Permissive. Permissive licenses are also known as “Apache style” or “BSD style.” They contain minimal 
# requirements about how the software can be modified or redistributed. This type of software license is
# perhaps the most popular license used with free and open source software. Aside from the Apache License
# and the BSD License, another common variant is the MIT License.

#LGPL. The GNU Lesser General Public License allows you to link to open source libraries in your software.
# If you simply compile or link an LGPL-licensed library with your own code, you can release your
# application under any license you want, even a proprietary license. But if you modify the library or
# copy parts of it into your code, you’ll have to release your application under similar terms as the 
# LGPL.

#Copyleft. Copyleft licenses are also known as reciprocal licenses or restrictive licenses. The most
# well-known example of a copyleft or reciprocal license is the GPL. These licenses allow you to modify 
# the licensed code and distribute new works based on it, as long as you distribute any new works or 
# adaptations under the same software license. For example, a component’s license might say the work is 
# free to use and distribute for personal use only. So any derivative you create would also be limited to
# personal use only. (A derivative is any new software you develop that contains the component.)

#The catch here is that the users of your software would also have the right to modify the code. 
# Therefore, you’d have to make your own source code available. But of course, exposing your source code 
# may not be in your best interests.

#Proprietary. Of all types of software licenses, this is the most restrictive. The idea behind it is that
# all rights are reserved. It’s generally used for proprietary software where the work may not be modified
# or redistributed.
